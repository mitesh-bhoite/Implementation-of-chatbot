# Chatbot Implementation using NLP

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is designed to understand user inputs, process them using NLP techniques, and generate appropriate responses. The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive chatbot capable of handling various user queries effectively.

## Features
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for conversation.
- **NLP-based Processing**: Uses Natural Language Processing for understanding user inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - spaCy
  - TensorFlow/Keras (if using deep learning models)
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - Flask/Django (for web deployment)
  - JSON (for storing predefined responses)
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset or publicly available chatbot datasets.

## Training Custom Model
If using a machine learning model, follow these steps:
1. Prepare and preprocess training data.
2. Train the model using TensorFlow/PyTorch.
3. Save the trained model and integrate it into the chatbot.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing advanced deep learning models for better response generation.
- Adding speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality.
- Deploying as a chatbot API or integrating with messaging platforms (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
